This project is currently under development.

**Stave** is a fast, lightweight, extensible web-based text annotation and visualization tool designed to support a wide range of data types and NLP tasks. Stave offers the following features:
  
- **Semantic Annotation**: supports both template and custom data types
- **Multi-document Annotation**: supports cross-document annotations and coreference
- **Customizable Interface**: supports creation of task-specific interface with independently developed plugins
- **Machine-Human Collaboration**: keeps human in the loop to verify and correct machine suggestions 
- **Easy Integration**: supports seamless integration with pre-built NLP workflows 
- **Safe Data Serialization**: supports a JSON-serializable format for easy data saving, loading and distribution 

Stave was originally developed and is actively contributed by [Petuum](https://petuum.com/) in collaboration with other institutes. A mirror of this repository is maintained by [Petuum Open Source](https://github.com/petuum).

- make sure your `python` command is using python3, or use a virtual env by:
  - `python3 -m venv venv` create virtual env (skip if already created)
  - `. venv/bin/activate` use virtual env
- make sure django is installded, or install it by:
  - `python -m pip install Django`
- `./start-dev.sh`
  - This script will create an example sqlite3 DB from SQL: `db.sqlite3`
